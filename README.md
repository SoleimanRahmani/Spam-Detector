# Spam-Detector
A simple Flask API to detect spam or ham messages using following Python packages:

* Sklearn
* Pandas
* Text Extraction

## Description
The purpose of this repository is to build a web app which classifies spam or ham (non-spam) messages. The goal of this project is to first, build the best machine learning model offline. In the next step, make the model available as a service by creating an API for the model using Flask. Finally, use the service to predict online where the user can submit a message for classification.

In the first step, several message classifiers have been implemented and compared in ```check.py``` file. The original meta-data file is a collection of messages tagged as spam or ham that can be found in Keggle.

In the secod step,







```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
